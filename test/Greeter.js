// `describe` is a Mocha function that allows you to organize your tests. It's
// not actually needed, but having your tests organized makes debugging them
// easier. All Mocha functions are available in the global scope.

// `describe` recieves the name of a section of your test suite, and a callback.
// The callback must define the tests of that section. This callback can't be
// an async function.
